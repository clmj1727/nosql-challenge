<h1  align="center">NoSQL Challenge: Eat Safe, Love ‚Äì UK Food Hygiene Analysis</h1>
<a name="readme-top"></a>

This project uses NoSQL (MongoDB) and Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) to analyze food hygiene data from the UK Food Standards Agency. This work was done in response to a data request by the food magazine *Eat Safe, Love*, which aims to help its editorial team make informed decisions about where to feature or avoid establishments across the UK.

## üìÅ Repository Overview
